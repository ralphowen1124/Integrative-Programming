What are the basic rules of XML you applied in this lab?
-It must have a one root element, every tag that will apply must have a closing tag. All tags are sensitive, the opening and closing tag must have the same capitalization. And it can't be overlap; the first one to open, it must be the first one to close. If there's any values, it must be double quoted.

Why does XML need a single root element?
- It function as the main container for all other elements. It certify the document has a clear, organized structure, and it allows the program to read and process the data accurately. Without one root element, the XML would be invalid and could not be properly parsed.

How does XML ensure interoperability?
- XML makes data sharing easy between different systems because it uses a standard text format that all programs can understand.
By following simple rules for structure and tags, XML lets information be read and used by different software, no matter what platform or device they’re on.
