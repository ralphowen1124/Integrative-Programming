1. readyState vs. status

readyState: tells you what's happening on the client-side (your browser).
status: tells you what happened on the server-side.
Common statuses include:
200 (OK): The request was successfull
404 (Not Found): The requested resource couldn't be found.
500 (Internal Server Error): Something went wrong on the server.

2. How to Make the Request Asynchronous

You make the request asynchronous by setting the third parameter of the open() method to true.

3. Why Asynchronous Communication is Recommended

Asynchronous communication is recommended almost exclusively for one critical reason: User Experience (UX). 
When you make a synchronous request (by setting open()'s third parameter to false), the browser's main thread stops and waits.
